Question 1



1. Variable = containers that are used to store values

2. Value = information that can be stored in a variable. like a Number, string , text , object, array.

3. Datatype = category of a value that determines the type of operations that can be performed on it and the way it is stored in memory

4. Initialization = assigning an initial value to a variable when it is declared. When you declare a variable, you can choose to immediately assign it a value, and that value becomes its initial value.

5. const = means that values cannot be reassigned once they have been initialized

    let = can be reassigned to a new value

    var = refers to the declared variables and can be used before a variable is declared also have accesible global scope
 
6. Variable scope = determines where and how a variable can be used

7. do while = when you want a function to run once

    for each = when you want to iterate over elements in an array and perform a specific action for each element

8. Hoisting = means you can use variables and functions before they are actually declared in your code.

Variable scoping = refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables within different parts of your code. In JavaScript, for example to access a variable in global scope or local scope
